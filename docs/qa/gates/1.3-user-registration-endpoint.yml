# Quality Gate Decision - Story 1.3
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "1.3"
story_title: "User Registration Endpoint"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Excellent implementation with comprehensive testing and strong code quality. One medium security consideration regarding email enumeration vulnerability. In-memory rate limiting documented as MVP solution. All functional requirements met."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

# Non-Functional Requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Strong password hashing (bcrypt 10 rounds), input validation, rate limiting. Email enumeration vulnerability noted but common MVP trade-off. No password complexity beyond length."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient queries, proper async/await, minimal database round trips. In-memory rate limiting acceptable for MVP."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling, standardized error format, all error paths tested"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code structure, JSDoc documentation, repository pattern, clean separation of concerns"
