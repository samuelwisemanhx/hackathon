# Quality Gate Decision - Story 1.2
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "1.2"
story_title: "User Database Schema"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Excellent implementation with comprehensive tests and proper constraints. Minor concern regarding token field length (255 chars may be insufficient for JWT tokens). Type sharing standard addressed via refactoring. Recommend addressing token length before auth service implementation."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
updated: "2025-10-27T16:46:37Z"

# Issues identified during review
top_issues:
  - id: "SCHEMA-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Token field varchar(255) may be insufficient for JWT tokens"
    detail: "JWT tokens with claims typically range 200-400+ characters. Current 255 limit could cause runtime errors."
    suggested_action: "Change sessions.token to text type or increase to varchar(512)"

  - id: "DEBT-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "No automatic updatedAt trigger implemented"
    detail: "Updated timestamp must be manually set on record updates, prone to human error"
    suggested_action: "Add database trigger for automatic updatedAt updates (can be deferred)"
