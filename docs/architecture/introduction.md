# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **AI Skills Assessment Application**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Decision:** This is a **greenfield project with pre-selected technology stack**. The architecture will build upon the SvelteKit 5 foundation with the following constraints:
- Must use SvelteKit 2 framework structure
- Must integrate PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- Must leverage SvelteKit's server-side capabilities (+server.ts routes)
- Deployment target is GCP Cloud Run with Node adapter

**Architectural Implications:**
- We can design the ideal project structure from scratch
- No legacy migration concerns
- Technology choices already made (not revisiting Svelte vs React, etc.)
- Focus on optimal implementation within SvelteKit ecosystem
