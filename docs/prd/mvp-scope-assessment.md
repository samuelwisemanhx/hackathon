# MVP Scope Assessment

## Scope Validation: ✅ Appropriate

**What's IN and Justified:**
- ✅ Auth (essential for personalized assessments)
- ✅ Assessment taking (core value)
- ✅ AI evaluation (differentiator)
- ✅ Results display (completes the loop)
- ✅ History tracking (enables improvement measurement)
- ✅ Auto-save (critical for 25-35 min experience)

**What's Appropriately OUT:**
- ✅ Password reset (can use email support for MVP)
- ✅ Social sharing (not core value)
- ✅ Admin dashboard (no admin use case defined)
- ✅ Export to PDF (nice-to-have)
- ✅ Multi-language (English-only MVP appropriate)

**Potential Over-Scope (Consider for Phase 2):**
- ⚠️ Assessment history with trends (Story 3.7) - Could defer trend calculation to v2, keep simple list view
- ⚠️ Download/print evaluation (Story 3.6 AC #9) - Listed as option, could be deferred

**Missing Features (Consider Adding):**
- ❓ "Abandon assessment" functionality - User might want to start over
- ❓ Basic admin view to see assessment completion stats (very minimal)

**Verdict**: Scope is lean and well-justified. All features directly serve core user journey. Minor consideration for deferring trend analysis.
