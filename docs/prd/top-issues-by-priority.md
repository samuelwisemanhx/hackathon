# Top Issues by Priority

## BLOCKERS: None
All critical requirements are present for architect to proceed.

## HIGH: Should Fix for Quality

1. **Performance Requirements Missing Quantification**
   - Issue: NFR5 mentions timeouts but no specific SLAs for page loads, API responses
   - Impact: Architect may make suboptimal choices without clear performance targets
   - Fix: Add specific metrics (e.g., "Dashboard loads in <2s", "Assessment auto-save completes in <500ms")

2. **No Explicit Data Retention Policy**
   - Issue: How long are assessments stored? Any GDPR/privacy considerations?
   - Impact: Database schema and operational costs unclear
   - Fix: Define retention period and deletion policy

## MEDIUM: Would Improve Clarity

3. **Missing Scalability Expectations**
   - Issue: NFR section doesn't specify expected user volume
   - Impact: Architect doesn't know if simple vs. scalable architecture needed
   - Fix: Add: "MVP targets <1000 users, <100 concurrent assessments"

4. **No Monitoring/Observability Requirements**
   - Issue: How will team know if AI API fails, database is slow, users are stuck?
   - Impact: Operational blindness in production
   - Fix: Add story or NFR about logging, error tracking, basic metrics

5. **User Research Section Empty**
   - Issue: No evidence of user validation for the assessment value proposition
   - Impact: Risk building something users don't want
   - Fix: Document assumptions or conduct lightweight validation

## LOW: Nice to Have

6. **No Deployment Strategy Mentioned**
   - Issue: Continuous deployment? Manual releases? Release cadence?
   - Fix: Add brief deployment approach to Technical Assumptions

7. **Missing Content Strategy**
   - Issue: Who writes help text, error messages, empty states?
   - Fix: Note that content is placeholder/developer-written for MVP
