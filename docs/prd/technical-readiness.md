# Technical Readiness

## Clarity of Technical Constraints: ✅ Excellent
- Tech stack clearly specified (Svelte 5, SvelteKit 2, PostgreSQL, Drizzle)
- Architecture approach defined (monolithic SvelteKit)
- AI provider specified (Anthropic Claude)
- Testing approach articulated

## Identified Technical Risks: ✅ Well-Documented
- AI response parsing brittleness (addressed with raw storage strategy)
- AI API timeouts (addressed with 120s timeout + UX handling)
- Database schema evolution (addressed with versioning consideration)

## Areas Needing Architect Investigation:
1. **AI Response Parsing Strategy** - Exact regex/markdown parsing approach for extracting scores
2. **Session Storage Mechanism** - SvelteKit session implementation details
3. **Database Schema Optimization** - Indexing strategy for assessment queries
4. **Progress Auto-Save Debouncing** - Implementation pattern for 2s debounce with optimistic locking

These are appropriate for architect to resolve - PM has provided sufficient constraints.
