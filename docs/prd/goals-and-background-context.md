# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Create an interactive web application that assesses users' AI skills through a prompt-driven test
- Provide users with personalized AI-generated recommendations based on their assessment results
- Enable user account management with standard registration and login functionality
- Store assessment results persistently for analysis and recommendation generation
- Deliver a functional MVP that transforms existing assessment prompts into an interactive experience

## Background Context

This project addresses the need for an accessible, web-based AI skills assessment tool. Currently, the assessment exists as a prompt, but lacks an interactive delivery mechanism and automated analysis capability. By building a web application, we enable users to take assessments independently, receive immediate AI-powered feedback, and track their progress over time.

The application will be built on an existing blank Svelte 5 application foundation, leveraging modern web technologies (SvelteKit 2, PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM) to deliver a full-stack solution that connects users with AI-powered assessment and recommendation capabilities.
