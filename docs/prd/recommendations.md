# Recommendations

## To Address HIGH Priority Items:

**1. Add Performance Requirements Section to PRD**
```markdown
## Performance Requirements
- Dashboard page load: <2 seconds (desktop, broadband)
- Assessment auto-save: <500ms response time
- AI evaluation processing: 30-90 seconds (with user feedback)
- Form field interactions: <100ms response (typing, clicking)
```

**2. Define Data Retention Policy**
```markdown
## Data Retention
- Assessment data retained indefinitely for user access
- Users can delete their account and all assessments on request
- No automatic data deletion in MVP
- GDPR compliance: User data export functionality deferred to post-MVP
```

**3. Add Scalability Expectations to Technical Assumptions**
```markdown
## Scalability Targets
- MVP targets: <1,000 registered users, <100 concurrent active assessments
- Database: Single PostgreSQL instance sufficient for MVP
- AI API: Sequential processing (no queue) acceptable for MVP volumes
```

## To Address MEDIUM Priority Items:

**4. Add Basic Monitoring Story to Epic 1**
```markdown
Story 1.7: Basic Logging and Error Tracking
- Server-side error logging to console/file
- Client-side error boundary for graceful failures
- Environment variable for log level (dev vs prod)
```

**5. Document User Research Assumptions**
```markdown
## User Research (Assumptions for MVP)
- Target users: Professionals using AI tools in their work (validated through prompt existence)
- Pain point: No objective way to measure AI fluency (assumption)
- Value hypothesis: Users want scored feedback + improvement roadmap
- MVP will validate: Do users complete 25-35 min assessment? Do they find results actionable?
```

## Next Steps Before Handoff to Architect:

1. ✅ **PRD is ready to hand off as-is** if timeline is priority
2. ⚠️ **OR spend 30 minutes** adding the 5 items above for higher quality handoff
3. Consider adding brief monitoring/logging story to Epic 1
