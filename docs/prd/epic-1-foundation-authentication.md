# Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication

Establish project infrastructure including SvelteKit application setup, PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM, core authentication system, and basic deployment configuration. This epic delivers a deployable application with user registration and login capabilities, providing the foundation for all subsequent features.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Database Configuration

As a **developer**,
I want **the SvelteKit 5 project initialized with PostgreSQL and Drizzle ORM configured**,
so that **I have a working development environment with database connectivity**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. SvelteKit 5 project is initialized with TypeScript support and recommended project structure
2. PostgreSQL database is configured for both local development and production environments
3. Drizzle ORM is installed and configured with connection pooling
4. Drizzle Kit is set up for schema migrations with initial migration created
5. Environment variables are properly configured (.env.example provided, .env in .gitignore)
6. Database connection is verified with a simple health check
7. Development server runs without errors on `npm run dev`
8. README contains setup instructions for local development

## Story 1.2: User Database Schema

As a **developer**,
I want **database schema defined for users and sessions**,
so that **I can store user accounts and manage authentication state**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Users table created with fields: id (UUID), email (unique), password_hash, created_at, updated_at
2. Sessions table created with fields: id, user_id (foreign key), token (unique), expires_at, created_at
3. Database indexes added on email (users) and token (sessions) for query performance
4. Drizzle schema types are exported for use in application code
5. Migration script successfully creates tables in database
6. Schema includes appropriate constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, foreign keys)

## Story 1.3: User Registration Endpoint

As a **new user**,
I want **to register an account with email and password**,
so that **I can access the assessment application**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. POST `/api/auth/register` endpoint accepts email and password
2. Email validation ensures valid format and uniqueness (returns error if email already exists)
3. Password validation requires minimum 8 characters
4. Password is hashed using bcrypt or argon2 before storage
5. Successful registration creates user record and returns success response (no auto-login)
6. Appropriate error responses for validation failures (400) and duplicate emails (409)
7. Endpoint includes basic rate limiting to prevent abuse
8. Unit tests cover validation logic and error cases

---

## Story 1.4: User Login and Session Management

As a **registered user**,
I want **to log in with my email and password**,
so that **I can access my account and assessments**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. POST `/api/auth/login` endpoint accepts email and password
2. Credentials are validated against stored user record
3. Successful login creates session token and stores in sessions table
4. Session token is returned via secure HTTP-only cookie with appropriate expiration
5. Failed login returns appropriate error (401) without revealing whether email exists
6. POST `/api/auth/logout` endpoint clears session token and invalidates session in database
7. Session middleware validates session token on protected routes
8. Integration tests cover complete login/logout flow

---

## Story 1.5: Registration and Login UI

As a **new or returning user**,
I want **clean, functional registration and login screens**,
so that **I can create an account or access my existing account**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. `/register` page displays registration form with email and password fields
2. `/login` page displays login form with email and password fields
3. Form validation provides real-time feedback for email format and password requirements
4. Submit buttons show loading state during API calls
5. Error messages from API are displayed clearly to the user
6. Successful registration redirects to login page with success message
7. Successful login redirects to dashboard/assessment home
8. Links between registration and login pages allow easy navigation
9. Forms are keyboard accessible and work on mobile devices
10. Password fields include show/hide toggle for usability

---

## Story 1.6: Basic Application Shell and Protected Routes

As a **logged-in user**,
I want **a consistent application layout with navigation and route protection**,
so that **I have a clear way to navigate the application and my session is secure**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Layout component includes header with app branding and user menu (when logged in)
2. User menu shows current user email and logout option
3. Protected routes (e.g., `/dashboard`, `/assessment`) redirect to `/login` if user is not authenticated
4. Session validation happens server-side using SvelteKit load functions
5. `/dashboard` page exists as placeholder landing page after login showing "Assessment Dashboard" heading
6. Logout functionality clears session and redirects to login page
7. Navigation is responsive and works on mobile devices
8. Basic loading states shown during authentication checks
