# Final Decision

**âœ… READY FOR ARCHITECT**

The PRD and epics are comprehensive, well-structured, and provide sufficient clarity for architectural design to begin. The identified gaps are non-blocking - the architect has clear direction on:
- Technical stack and constraints
- User flows and feature requirements
- Epic sequencing and story breakdown
- Testing expectations

The PARTIAL ratings in Categories 1, 5, and 8 reflect typical MVP trade-offs (limited user research, streamlined NFRs, minimal operational overhead) rather than critical deficiencies. These can be addressed incrementally as the product matures.

**Recommendation**: Proceed to architecture phase. Consider adding performance metrics and monitoring story during architecture design if time permits.
