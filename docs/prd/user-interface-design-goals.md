# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The application delivers a focused, distraction-free assessment experience that guides users through a comprehensive 25-35 minute evaluation process. The interface balances professional credibility with approachability, making a complex multi-part assessment feel manageable through clear progress indicators, contextual help, and intelligent state preservation. Upon completion, users receive their evaluation in a scannable, structured format that prioritizes actionable insights while maintaining the depth and rigor of the analysis.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Progressive disclosure**: Users see one section at a time to reduce cognitive load, with clear navigation to review or jump between sections
- **Auto-save and progress persistence**: Responses are saved automatically as users type, allowing them to leave and return without data loss
- **Contextual guidance**: Question descriptions and examples are readily available without cluttering the interface
- **Visual progress tracking**: Clear indicators show completion status across all 6 parts and within each section
- **Results presentation hierarchy**: Evaluation results use progressive disclosure - summary scores visible immediately, detailed analysis expandable on demand

## Core Screens and Views

- **Landing/Welcome Page**: Brief overview of assessment purpose, time commitment, and value proposition with CTA to login/register
- **Registration/Login Screen**: Standard authentication with email/password
- **Assessment Dashboard**: Shows assessment status (not started / in progress / completed) and history of past assessments
- **Assessment Interface**: Multi-step form presenting one part/section at a time with navigation, progress bar, and auto-save indicators
- **Processing Screen**: Engaging wait state while AI evaluation is running (30-90 seconds) with appropriate messaging
- **Results Display**: Structured presentation of evaluation output with hierarchical organization (scores → analysis → roadmap → action items)
- **Assessment History**: List view of past assessments with dates, scores, and ability to view full results

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

Target WCAG 2.1 AA compliance including keyboard navigation, proper form labels, sufficient color contrast, and screen reader compatibility for assessment questions and results.

## Branding

Clean, professional aesthetic that conveys credibility and focus. Minimal visual distraction during assessment. Results presentation should feel authoritative yet approachable - think "professional evaluation report" rather than "gamified quiz results."

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary use case is desktop/laptop (given the extensive text input required for 25-35 minute assessment), but must be fully functional on tablets and mobile devices with responsive layouts that adapt form fields and results presentation appropriately.
