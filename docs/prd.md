# AI Skills Assessment Application Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Create an interactive web application that assesses users' AI skills through a prompt-driven test
- Provide users with personalized AI-generated recommendations based on their assessment results
- Enable user account management with standard registration and login functionality
- Store assessment results persistently for analysis and recommendation generation
- Deliver a functional MVP that transforms existing assessment prompts into an interactive experience

### Background Context

This project addresses the need for an accessible, web-based AI skills assessment tool. Currently, the assessment exists as a prompt, but lacks an interactive delivery mechanism and automated analysis capability. By building a web application, we enable users to take assessments independently, receive immediate AI-powered feedback, and track their progress over time.

The application will be built on an existing blank Svelte 5 application foundation, leveraging modern web technologies (SvelteKit 2, PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM) to deliver a full-stack solution that connects users with AI-powered assessment and recommendation capabilities.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The application delivers a focused, distraction-free assessment experience that guides users through a comprehensive 25-35 minute evaluation process. The interface balances professional credibility with approachability, making a complex multi-part assessment feel manageable through clear progress indicators, contextual help, and intelligent state preservation. Upon completion, users receive their evaluation in a scannable, structured format that prioritizes actionable insights while maintaining the depth and rigor of the analysis.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Progressive disclosure**: Users see one section at a time to reduce cognitive load, with clear navigation to review or jump between sections
- **Auto-save and progress persistence**: Responses are saved automatically as users type, allowing them to leave and return without data loss
- **Contextual guidance**: Question descriptions and examples are readily available without cluttering the interface
- **Visual progress tracking**: Clear indicators show completion status across all 6 parts and within each section
- **Results presentation hierarchy**: Evaluation results use progressive disclosure - summary scores visible immediately, detailed analysis expandable on demand

### Core Screens and Views

- **Landing/Welcome Page**: Brief overview of assessment purpose, time commitment, and value proposition with CTA to login/register
- **Registration/Login Screen**: Standard authentication with email/password
- **Assessment Dashboard**: Shows assessment status (not started / in progress / completed) and history of past assessments
- **Assessment Interface**: Multi-step form presenting one part/section at a time with navigation, progress bar, and auto-save indicators
- **Processing Screen**: Engaging wait state while AI evaluation is running (30-90 seconds) with appropriate messaging
- **Results Display**: Structured presentation of evaluation output with hierarchical organization (scores → analysis → roadmap → action items)
- **Assessment History**: List view of past assessments with dates, scores, and ability to view full results

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

Target WCAG 2.1 AA compliance including keyboard navigation, proper form labels, sufficient color contrast, and screen reader compatibility for assessment questions and results.

### Branding

Clean, professional aesthetic that conveys credibility and focus. Minimal visual distraction during assessment. Results presentation should feel authoritative yet approachable - think "professional evaluation report" rather than "gamified quiz results."

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary use case is desktop/laptop (given the extensive text input required for 25-35 minute assessment), but must be fully functional on tablets and mobile devices with responsive layouts that adapt form fields and results presentation appropriately.

---

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single repository containing both frontend (SvelteKit) and backend API/database logic. Given the tight integration between UI and data models, and the relatively small scope of the application, a monorepo simplifies development and deployment.

### Service Architecture

**Monolithic SvelteKit application with server-side API routes**. The application will use SvelteKit's built-in server capabilities (+server.ts routes) to handle:
- Authentication and session management
- Database operations via Drizzle ORM
- AI API calls to external services (Anthropic/OpenAI)
- Business logic for formatting prompts and parsing responses

This approach leverages SvelteKit's full-stack capabilities, avoiding the complexity of separate frontend/backend services for an MVP.

### Testing Requirements

**Unit testing for critical business logic** including:
- Prompt formatting logic (converting user responses to grader prompt input format)
- Response parsing logic (extracting scores and structured data from AI output)
- Authentication and authorization logic
- Database schema validation

**Integration testing** for key user flows:
- Complete assessment submission and grading workflow
- User registration and login flow
- Progress save/resume functionality

**Manual testing** for UI/UX validation and AI response handling edge cases.

Focus on automated tests for data integrity and business logic; manual validation for user experience and AI integration quality.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **AI Provider**: Use Anthropic Claude API (Sonnet 4.5 or similar) for grading evaluations as recommended in the grader prompt. Fallback to OpenAI GPT-4+ if needed.
- **Session Management**: Use SvelteKit's built-in session handling with secure HTTP-only cookies
- **Database Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema migrations and version control
- **Environment Configuration**: Support for local development (SQLite/PostgreSQL) and production (PostgreSQL) environments
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses from API routes with appropriate user-facing messages for common failures (AI timeout, network issues, validation errors)
- **Deployment Target**: Designed for deployment to Vercel, Netlify, or similar platforms that support SvelteKit with PostgreSQL database connection
- **AI Response Parsing**: Implement robust parsing to handle variations in AI output format while extracting the structured sections (scores, roadmap, etc.)
- **Data Retention**: Store both raw AI responses and parsed structured data for audit trail and future re-parsing if needed

   - Issue: NFR5 mentions timeouts but no specific SLAs for page loads, API responses
   - Impact: Architect may make suboptimal choices without clear performance targets
   - Fix: Add specific metrics (e.g., "Dashboard loads in <2s", "Assessment auto-save completes in <500ms")

2. **No Explicit Data Retention Policy**
   - Issue: How long are assessments stored? Any GDPR/privacy considerations?
   - Impact: Database schema and operational costs unclear
   - Fix: Define retention period and deletion policy

### MEDIUM: Would Improve Clarity

3. **Missing Scalability Expectations**
   - Issue: NFR section doesn't specify expected user volume
   - Impact: Architect doesn't know if simple vs. scalable architecture needed
   - Fix: Add: "MVP targets <1000 users, <100 concurrent assessments"

4. **No Monitoring/Observability Requirements**
   - Issue: How will team know if AI API fails, database is slow, users are stuck?
   - Impact: Operational blindness in production
   - Fix: Add story or NFR about logging, error tracking, basic metrics

5. **User Research Section Empty**
   - Issue: No evidence of user validation for the assessment value proposition
   - Impact: Risk building something users don't want
   - Fix: Document assumptions or conduct lightweight validation

### LOW: Nice to Have

6. **No Deployment Strategy Mentioned**
   - Issue: Continuous deployment? Manual releases? Release cadence?
   - Fix: Add brief deployment approach to Technical Assumptions

7. **Missing Content Strategy**
   - Issue: Who writes help text, error messages, empty states?
   - Fix: Note that content is placeholder/developer-written for MVP

## MVP Scope Assessment

### Scope Validation: ✅ Appropriate

**What's IN and Justified:**
- ✅ Auth (essential for personalized assessments)
- ✅ Assessment taking (core value)
- ✅ AI evaluation (differentiator)
- ✅ Results display (completes the loop)
- ✅ History tracking (enables improvement measurement)
- ✅ Auto-save (critical for 25-35 min experience)

**What's Appropriately OUT:**
- ✅ Password reset (can use email support for MVP)
- ✅ Social sharing (not core value)
- ✅ Admin dashboard (no admin use case defined)
- ✅ Export to PDF (nice-to-have)
- ✅ Multi-language (English-only MVP appropriate)

**Potential Over-Scope (Consider for Phase 2):**
- ⚠️ Assessment history with trends (Story 3.7) - Could defer trend calculation to v2, keep simple list view
- ⚠️ Download/print evaluation (Story 3.6 AC #9) - Listed as option, could be deferred

**Missing Features (Consider Adding):**
- ❓ "Abandon assessment" functionality - User might want to start over
- ❓ Basic admin view to see assessment completion stats (very minimal)

**Verdict**: Scope is lean and well-justified. All features directly serve core user journey. Minor consideration for deferring trend analysis.

## Technical Readiness

### Clarity of Technical Constraints: ✅ Excellent
- Tech stack clearly specified (Svelte 5, SvelteKit 2, PostgreSQL, Drizzle)
- Architecture approach defined (monolithic SvelteKit)
- AI provider specified (Anthropic Claude)
- Testing approach articulated

### Identified Technical Risks: ✅ Well-Documented
- AI response parsing brittleness (addressed with raw storage strategy)
- AI API timeouts (addressed with 120s timeout + UX handling)
- Database schema evolution (addressed with versioning consideration)

### Areas Needing Architect Investigation:
1. **AI Response Parsing Strategy** - Exact regex/markdown parsing approach for extracting scores
2. **Session Storage Mechanism** - SvelteKit session implementation details
3. **Database Schema Optimization** - Indexing strategy for assessment queries
4. **Progress Auto-Save Debouncing** - Implementation pattern for 2s debounce with optimistic locking

These are appropriate for architect to resolve - PM has provided sufficient constraints.

## Recommendations

### To Address HIGH Priority Items:

**1. Add Performance Requirements Section to PRD**
```markdown
### Performance Requirements
- Dashboard page load: <2 seconds (desktop, broadband)
- Assessment auto-save: <500ms response time
- AI evaluation processing: 30-90 seconds (with user feedback)
- Form field interactions: <100ms response (typing, clicking)
```

**2. Define Data Retention Policy**
```markdown
### Data Retention
- Assessment data retained indefinitely for user access
- Users can delete their account and all assessments on request
- No automatic data deletion in MVP
- GDPR compliance: User data export functionality deferred to post-MVP
```

**3. Add Scalability Expectations to Technical Assumptions**
```markdown
### Scalability Targets
- MVP targets: <1,000 registered users, <100 concurrent active assessments
- Database: Single PostgreSQL instance sufficient for MVP
- AI API: Sequential processing (no queue) acceptable for MVP volumes
```

### To Address MEDIUM Priority Items:

**4. Add Basic Monitoring Story to Epic 1**
```markdown
Story 1.7: Basic Logging and Error Tracking
- Server-side error logging to console/file
- Client-side error boundary for graceful failures
- Environment variable for log level (dev vs prod)
```

**5. Document User Research Assumptions**
```markdown
### User Research (Assumptions for MVP)
- Target users: Professionals using AI tools in their work (validated through prompt existence)
- Pain point: No objective way to measure AI fluency (assumption)
- Value hypothesis: Users want scored feedback + improvement roadmap
- MVP will validate: Do users complete 25-35 min assessment? Do they find results actionable?
```

### Next Steps Before Handoff to Architect:

1. ✅ **PRD is ready to hand off as-is** if timeline is priority
2. ⚠️ **OR spend 30 minutes** adding the 5 items above for higher quality handoff
3. Consider adding brief monitoring/logging story to Epic 1

## Final Decision

**✅ READY FOR ARCHITECT**

The PRD and epics are comprehensive, well-structured, and provide sufficient clarity for architectural design to begin. The identified gaps are non-blocking - the architect has clear direction on:
- Technical stack and constraints
- User flows and feature requirements
- Epic sequencing and story breakdown
- Testing expectations

The PARTIAL ratings in Categories 1, 5, and 8 reflect typical MVP trade-offs (limited user research, streamlined NFRs, minimal operational overhead) rather than critical deficiencies. These can be addressed incrementally as the product matures.

**Recommendation**: Proceed to architecture phase. Consider adding performance metrics and monitoring story during architecture design if time permits.
